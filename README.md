Includes implementation of lexer in two different ways.
First part of the assignment I used Flex to generate a valid lexer for G++.
In the other part, I implemented a lexer for G++ in Lisp. 

Rules are given in CSE341_Assignment_1.pdf file.

To run Flex part of assigment, you may use Makefile.
For Lisp part you should enter clisp gpp_lexer.lisp command to your terminal.

Both parts of the assignment can take the input file as parameters. If the input file is not given as a parameter, inputs are expected from the user.
